!3 Compare results for Employee: Sue

'''Comment tables like this are not required for the test but it is good practice to display the key test conditions in a way that can be quickly understood'''

# Use |Comment| so Dbfit doesn't treat this as a command fixture and preced with "-" so that the the "Comment" row is not displayed
-|Comment|
|!c '''Sales Person'''|!c '''Customer Type'''|!c '''Some Other Parameter'''|
|''Sue''|''V''|''NULL''|

''In the comment table above, we use "!c" to centre the text within a cell, wrap values in three single quotes to make them bold or two single quotes to display values as italics.  The raw text definition looks like this:''

{{{
-|Comment|
|!c '''Sales Person'''|!c '''Customer Type'''|!c '''Some Other Parameter'''|
|''Sue''|''V''|''NULL''|
}}}


'''It is good practice to include a block of text to replicate the call from within SQL server Management Studio.'''

This makes it easy to generate the expected results when preparing integration tests for known-good code. However, you need to be careful to keep the procedure call and the test condition values below in sync.

''Use this block to replicate this call in SSMS...''
{{{
EXEC CRMCORESTG.dbFitDemo.usp_TutorialTestSuiteGetResultSet
	  @CustomerType       = 'V'
	, @SalesPerson        = 'Sue'
	, @SomeOtherParameter = NULL
GO
}}}

Although the "Query" fixture supports specifying input parameters in-line, specifying them in a table format like this makes them easier to read.

''We use camel case for the variable name so that the wiki doesn't think parameter names actually refer to a wiki page''

#The space formatting shown here is not required but can make the raw text easier to understand
|Set Parameter|pCustomerType          |V|
|Set Parameter|pSalesPerson           |Sue|
|Set Parameter|pSomeOtherParameter    |NULL|

''Note that we specify NULL values as "NULL" (without quotes). Specify an empty string with two single quotes.''

'''There are three elements to the "Query" fixture'''

 1 The Query definition including the parameters (named as per the above "Set Parameter" table with an "@" added
 2 The column names
 3 The expect row values

!|Query|EXEC dbFitDemo.usp_TutorialTestSuiteGetResultSet @pCustomerType, @pSalesPerson, @pSomeOtherParameter|
|CustomerId|CustomerName|DateOfBirth|CustomerType|SalesPerson|YearToDateSales|
|2|Steven|1965-01-03|V|Sue|151.00|
|14|Jeremy|1981-07-13|V|Sue|357.00|
|16|Oliver|1954-08-23|V|Sue|258.00|
|18|Martin|1965-09-03|V|Sue|359.00|
|20|Dennis|1971-10-13|V|Sue|150.00|

By default, Dbfit doesn't care about row order.  The stored procedure in this test returns results ordered by customer name but the expected results above are ordered by Id.
